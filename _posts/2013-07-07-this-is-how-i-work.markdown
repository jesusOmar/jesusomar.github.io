I honestly have no idea why I'm writing this... Maybe years from now it would bring a good laugh; maybe it's a mental backup in case my computer crashes; or maybe is simply out of boredom.

Hello, my name is Jesus Omar and this is how I work. A typical day for me begins at around 10:30 or 11:00 AM, when I usually wake up and jump into the shower. By 11:30 we usually have our first team meeting.

After a few hours of catching up with the team and getting the priorities for the day, I open up my [sublime text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) editor, start my local [zend server](https://www.zend.com/en/products/server/) and start hacking away at some problem. This usually consists of searching [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) for a piece of code that might help my situation and or reading the documentation of [Symfony](http://symfony.com/) to bend it to my will.

After 2 or 3 hours of work I usually take a break to read [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/), or watch one or two anime episodes on [crunchyroll](http://www.crunchyroll.com/) before digging into either a new problem or going back to the previews one.

This continues until I'm either to exhausted to continue, or I have to leave the house. If I don't have anything plan then this means I'm usually hacking away until 2 or 3 in the morning.

Anyways as I said at the beginning I have no idea why I'm writing all of this.... maybe is to remind me in the future on how hard I once worked.
